I'm a passionate computer scientist studying in my final year at Heriot Watt University in computer systems. My degree has taught me many technical skills and work based skills such as managing time and workload. I'm the type of programmer that needs to visually see his output, whether it be a small mechanic or a large impact.

I made this website because I recognise the importance of demonstrating my taste in, I created this portfolio to share my hobbies and projects with others.

I believe I have a good taste in design, when it comes to looks and what clicks with people, but at the end of the day I'm a software engineer.
