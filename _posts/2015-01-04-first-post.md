title: First game!

This was the first game I ever programmed, the inspiration came from my mother, she loves the mario games and always wanted to play on her computer since we don't have the old gameboy anymore, so I created this game for use on the MAC. 

I used the LibGDX library (based on OpenGL) and programmed this game in Java. The assets were ripped out of previous mario gameboy games, as I am not an artist, I'm a programmer.
