# C Basics:

**Defined/Declared**

In the C language, all 

**Matrix:**
  2 ways to define matrix in C:
  1. Malloc
  2. Uniform definition
  
  The first way: 
  ```C
  int matrix[10][10];
  
  ```
  
  The second way (dynamic):
  ```C
  int Row = 2; int Col = 2;
  int size = Row * Col;
  int ** mat4 = (int**) malloc (Row * sizeof(int*))
  for (int i = 0; i<Row; i++){
  mat4[i] = (int*)malloc(Col * sizeof (int));
  }
  ```
  
  **Maths**
  Ceil and Floor, included in <math.h>, return a digit rounded to the highest or lower number, e.g. 5.5 will return 6 for ceil and 5.5 will return 5 for floor.
  
# C uncommon:
  
  **Swap two integer variables x and y:**
  
  The basic way:
  ```C
  int t = 0; //temp var
  int x=2;
  int y=4;
  t = x;
  x = y;
  y = t;
  ```
  Arithmetic/Logic way XOR:
  
  
  **Matrix Stored As 1D Array:**
  This is a more uncommon method of allocating and using a matrix, its is proven to be more efficient than using the 
  ```C
  int row = 2, col = 2;
  int size = row * col;
  int* mat4 = (int*)malloc(size * sizeof(int));
  ```
